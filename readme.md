# React-Redux Boilerplate

This repository is for getting you up and building React-Redux Applications.

To get started, clone this repo.
If you do not have Wepback, you may need to install it globally:

```
$ npm install -g webpack
```

To start a local development server:

```
$ webpack-dev-server
```


This repository uses [EOS](https://github.com/amattson21/eos-redux) for boilerplate generation.
If you want to use EOS for this purpose, install it globally:

```
$ npm install -g eos-redux
```
